create a guessing game that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it the program should prompt the user to input their guess compare it to the generated number and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low and it should continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then prints the number it took to win the game using Java


Below is a simple Java program that implements the guessing game you described. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and prompts the user to guess the number. It provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and continues until the user correctly guesses the number. Finally, it prints the number of attempts it took to win the game
